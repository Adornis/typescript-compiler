## TypeScript compilers for Meteor.

Package exposes three TypeScript compilers: `TsBatchCompiler`, `TsCachingCompiler` and `TsCompiler` to be used in a Meteor compiler plugin.

[This](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript) TypeScript package is used as a TypeScript provider.

## Getting Started
Add new package (into the packages folder) and register new Meteor plugin there:
````js
Package.registerBuildPlugin({
  name: 'TSBuilder',
  sources: [
    'ts_handler.js'
  ],
  use: [
    'barbatus:ts-compilers@0.1.8',
    'ecmascript@0.1.4'
  ]
});
````
In `ts_handler.js`, add one of two provided compilers as follows:

````js
Plugin.registerCompiler({
  extensions: ['ts'],
}, () => new TsCachingCompiler());
````

Please, check out how everything works in the demo app.

## Compilers
### TsBatchCompiler
Compiles all passed `.ts`-files at once using internally [`TypeScript.transpileFiles`](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript/blob/master/typescript.js#L87).

TypeScript can potentially transpile all files together a bit more effiently using internal cache.

### TsCachingCompiler
Extends Meteor's [`MultiFileCachingCompiler`](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/caching-compiler) and compiles one file content at a time using this method [`TypeScript.transpile`](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript/blob/master/typescript.js#L96) internally.

### TsCompiler
Main compiler that wraps two above compilers and use a particular one at a moment depending on the confiration provided.
Currently, if `useCache` is set then `TsCachingCompiler` is used, otherwise - `TsBatchCompiler`.

## TypeScript Config
Compilers can be configured via `.tsconfig` in the app root folder. Format of the `.tsconfig` follows the `compilerOptions` part with the same options as you can fine in the standard `.tsconfig` file [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/tsconfig.json); `files` part is omitted.

Some of the TypeScript options are preset to be always turned on or off according to details of the Meteor environment. You can read about exceptions [here](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript).

A couple of additional options have been added: `alwaysThrow` and `useCache`.

When `alwaysThrow` is set, the compiler will always throw exceptions whenever syntactic or symantic error occurs. Otherwise, it throws by default only on syntactic errors, semantic ones (like module resolution errors, unknown variables etc) are just logged in the terminal.

`useCache` simple says compiler to turn on/off caching results.

## Compilation Speed-up
`noResolve` is designated to turn on/off module resolution process. During that process TypeScript checks availability of each module and verify that API usage is correct as well, which can be quite time assuming especially
for big apps because each imported module's file is being read and parsed.

Therefor, you might consider turning it off during intensive development when Meteor is running and changes applied just-in-time. TypeScript will skip resolving each module but will continue cursing on syntactic errors.
From time to time you can switch `noResolve` back to false with the `useCache` set to false and re-start Meteor.
You'll see all mistakes (if any) you have made including missing modules errors or incorrect API usage etc.

## Example of usage
Please, check Angular2's demo called Socially [here](https://github.com/Urigo/Meteor-Angular2/tree/master/examples/parties). It's built fully in TypeScript and uses `.tsconfig` as well.
